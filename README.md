# Knowledge-Augmented Hate Speech Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a system for detecting hate speech in online content using knowledge augmentation techniques. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of detection algorithms by incorporating external knowledge sources.

## Features
- **Real-time Hate Speech Detection**: Analyze text in real-time to identify hate speech.
- **Knowledge Augmentation**: Leverage external knowledge bases to improve detection accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Capable of processing text in various languages.

## Architecture
The system is built on a multi-layer architecture:
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and preprocesses input data.
- **Processing Layer**: Implements detection algorithms and integrates knowledge sources.
- **Output Layer**: Provides results to the user and logs insights for further analysis.

## Methodology
The methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of text samples.
2. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models using the collected data.
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating external knowledge to enhance model performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the effectiveness of the detection system through various metrics.
